## Micro-frontend: Product Exploration

The Product Exploration micro-frontend presents users with a wide range of products spanning various categories. It allows them to explore detailed information about each product, including pricing, producer details, and importantly, comprehensive insights into the treatment of animals throughout their lifecycle. Additionally, users have the ability to save products to their favourites and provide feedback, while also being able to view feedback from other users. This decision to designate it as a micro-frontend was influenced by its role as the central hub for all activities related to product exploration, making it a logical choice for micro-frontend implementation.
