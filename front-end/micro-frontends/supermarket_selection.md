## Micro-frontend: Supermarket Selection

The Supermarket Selection micro-frontend allows users to choose a supermarket from a list. Once selected, users can view the supermarket's location on both a map and in street view. This decision to categorize it as a micro-frontend stemmed from its ability to provide comprehensive coverage of all supermarket-related information, seamlessly integrating location and product selection process.
