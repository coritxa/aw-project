## Micro-frontend: User Profile

The User Profile micro-frontend houses functionalities associated with user management. It facilitates user login and enables account management tasks, including options like adjusting settings and uploading a profile picture. Despite initial considerations for separate treatment, integration was favored to improve simplicity and coherence. This aligns with common industry practices, where these tasks are typically managed collectively by the ‘authentication’ team.
